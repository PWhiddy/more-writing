title: Creating a CLIP sorted Mosaic from Computerender Images
---

I launched [computerender](https://computerender.com/) at the end of last year, and already its users have generated over 1 million images! 
  
I made some [small modifications to the code](https://github.com/PWhiddy/sp-mosaic/blob/main/mosaic_dl.py) I used to create a mosaic for the content created on [shaderpark](https://shaderpark.com), and generated a 33k x 33k image by tiling together over 1M images shrunk to 32x32 resolution.
  
Here's the result!
