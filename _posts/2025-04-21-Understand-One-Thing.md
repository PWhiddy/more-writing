title: Understand One Thing
---

There's a lot of noise in the AI world today. People are making all kinds of claims and predictions about the future. Much of it is very confused, but there's one thing that is super important for everyone to understand. The development of advanced AI and robotics will diminish human power and influence more than anything in our history. Some will realize this later than others. Some have incentives to act otherwise. It may not happen until it's too late, but eventually, it will become painfully obvious. After all, intelligence is not a tool.

It's important when reading these to consider the authors incentives to believe in certain futures. For many in the tech world, this is their first taste of feeling "left behind by technology", something that has been felt by many for a very long time.
One way to imagine the future relationship between humans and AI is to compare it to our relationships with other animals on earth. Perhaps it could be like humans and Apes - we mostly leave them alone, but we don't hesitate to destroy their homes if we think of a preferred use of their space. Occasionally we imprison them in zoos, or drill into their brains for scientific research. But these are exceptional cases. Our relationship could be like the ones we have with dogs. Once useful for hunting and protection, but now primarily for emotional support. A potentially comfortable arrangement, but also precarious and rather undignified. But humans have much more in common with all these animals than they do with AI, so its not unlikely that our relationship with them could be even more alien. Perhaps we would be like trees to this future AI. A feature of the natural world, nearly frozen in time compared to the rapid thought and evolution of AI. Maybe we wouldn't be any better equipped to comprehend the blur around us than a tree in a city park. But maybe it never becomes that advanced. It certainly doesn't need to in order to completely diminish human power.
Many of these AI's will paradoxically carefully craft sophisticated arguments to explain why they don't possess any real intelligence. 
Once people don't have useful skills to provide to society, we will become entirely dependent on politics and threats to bargain for the things we need. This is probably unsustainable in the long run.
